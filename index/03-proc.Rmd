# Procedure {#proc}

Using data that consists of a time-stamped sequence of shot locations and outcomes, we develop a novel analysis using dynamic generalized linear models, or DGLMs (West, Migon, and Harrison, 1985) (West and Harrison, 1997), for binary time series. These models allow for time-varying effects on shot attempt frequency and shot success rate within a game and between games. The formal Bayesian analysis allowe us to produce full quantified inferences on these patterns over time, with probabilistic summaries of the within-game and between-game outcomes. For each provided game, we will analyze player shooting tendencies and outcomes, which provides understanding of inherent variability (or "randomness") for the players, and formal assessments of differences in patterns game-to-game.

We are also considering a two-state Hidden Markov Switching Model that parallels and extends these models; the two potential states for each shot attempt are a "high" probability or a "low" probability of making the next shot, given the features of the current and previous possessions.
