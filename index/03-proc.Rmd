# Procedure {#proc}

Using the time-stamped sequence of shot locations and binary outcomes, we fit generalized linear models, hierarchichal models, and discounted likelihood models. The discounted likelihood models allow for time-varying effects on shot success rate between games. The formal Bayesian analysis allows us to produce full quantified inferences on these patterns over time, with probabilistic summaries of the between-game outcomes. For each provided game, we will analyze player shooting tendencies and outcomes, which provides understanding of inherent variability (or "randomness") for the players, and formal assessments of differences in patterns game-to-game.

We are also considering a two-state Hidden Markov Switching Model that parallels and extends these models; the two potential states for each shot attempt are a "high" probability or a "low" probability of making the next shot, given the features of the current and previous possessions.
