Our results so far suggest that some insights can be taken by predicting basketball shooting outcomes, but none of our results so far are more insightful than what one could find by watching a game (i.e. the most frequent shooters are usually above average shooters, or the probability of making a shot decreases as distance from the basket increases). The three models we have fit so far (GLM, DGLM, and Hierarchical) either not realistic enough, or do not fit well enough. We could refine our models by including more predictors such as a proxy for fatigue (using information about total minutes played, or consecutive minutes played without a timeout), or shot difficulty (using information about the nearest defender).

Future goals for this research are to build a better-fitting model to predict basketball shots, and to thoroughly investigate the time-dependency of the predictive features.
