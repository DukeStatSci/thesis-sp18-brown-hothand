Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

In the sport of basketball, points are awarded by the binary event of shooting the ball into the goal. Some factors we consider that may affect the success rate include the location of the shooter, the individual skill of the shooter, whether the shooter is playing on his home court or on an away court, and the shooting success in recent surrounding games. There have been previous studies on how much recent shooting success affects current shooting success, and the results vary. For example, *insert examples from literature review*.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate Bayesian modelling techniques shooting data, and to learn more about time-dependency in shooting data.
