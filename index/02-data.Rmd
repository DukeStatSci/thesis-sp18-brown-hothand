# Data {#data}

The data for this analysis is from SportVU, a player-tracking system from STATS, LLC. that provides precise coordinates for all ten players and the ball 25 times per second. The Duke University Men's Basketball team permitted the use of their SportVU data from the _blank_ to _blank_ basketball seasons. However, since the ability to record this data depends on six specialized tracking cameras, Duke does not have this data for every game they play---only home games, and a few road games. Therefore, there is some missing data _blank_.

Each game has the following associated files:

- Box Score Optical:

- Final Sequence Optical (one for each half and each overtime period):

- Final Sequence Play-by-Play Optical:
