The proposed study is an investigation of Bayesian statistical models
and analyses for problems arising in shooting a basketball. Goals will
be to explore, develop and apply Bayesian models to existing and new
data on shooting outcomes, to understand and evaluate questions of
inherent random variation, changes over time in shooting performance,
and issues related to the ``Hot Hand'' concept in sports.

\chapter*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

Welcome to the \emph{R Markdown} thesis template. This template is based
on (and in many places copied directly from) the Reed College LaTeX
template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that
have never used TeX or LaTeX before. Using \emph{R Markdown} will also
allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in \textbf{R} chunks of
code, with the resulting plots and output included as well. The hope is
this \emph{R Markdown} template gets you in the habit of doing
reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but
also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto
your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and
you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis. The use of
LaTeX in combination with \emph{Markdown} is more consistent than the
output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing,
and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have
never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going
to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written
before, taxing Word's capabilities. After working with \emph{Markdown}
and \textbf{R} together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be
your reporting style of choice going forward.

\textbf{Why use it?}

\emph{R Markdown} creates a simple and straightforward way to interface
with the beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in \textbf{R} to
work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and
paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX,
\emph{R Markdown} also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it
and to visualize it using \textbf{R} functions, and also to provide the
documentation and commentary on the results of your project. Further, it
allows for \textbf{R} results to be passed inline to the commentary of
your results. You'll see more on this later.

Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora
of benefits!

\textbf{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures,
complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance
of their document should use \emph{R Markdown}. Of particular use should
be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of
\emph{Markdown} and its ability to keep track of and easily include
figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references,
table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone
writing a thesis project.

\chapter{Literature Review}\label{litreview}

Gilovich, Vallone, \& Tversky (1985)

A. survey of basketball fans
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  qualitative questions, opinions
\item
  hypothetical preditions (FT\% on \#2 given \#1 was a hit)
\item
  streak detection
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    asked to classify sequences as ``chance'', ``streak'', or
    ``alternate''
  \item
    alternation probability = 0.5 was considered streaky by 62\% of
    subjects
  \item
    people not only perceive random sequences as positively correlated,
    they also perceive negatively correlated sequences as random
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
B. FG analysis from NBA games
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  autocorrelation between conditional probs P(H\textbar{}M1), P(H),
  P(H\textbar{}H1), etc.
\item
  paired t-test between the diff conditional probs (like
  P(H\textbar{}M1) and P(H\textbar{}H1))
\item
  Wald-Wolfowitz run test
\item
  Stationarity:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Chi-Sq test to look at if disjoint bins of shots followed expected
    distribution of ``high'', ``med'', and ``low'' performance.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Hot and Cold Night variability
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    look at flucutation between std erros of games and std error of
    season
  \item
    Lexis ratio (SE obs / SE expc) should be significantly
    \textgreater{} 1
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
C. FT analysis from NBA games

\item
  controlled experiment with Cornell basketball player.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
\begin{verbatim}
 process:
\end{verbatim}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    For each player we determined a distance from which his or her
    shooting percentage was roughly 50\%. At this distance we then drew
    two 15-ft arcs on the floor from which each player took all of his
    or her shots. The centers of the arcs were located 60 degrees out
    from the left and right sides of the basket. When shooting baskets,
    the players were required to move along the arc between shots so
    that consecutive shots were never taken from exactly the same spot.
    Each player was to take 100 shots, 50 from each arc.
  \item
    We tested players' ability to predict hits and misses by having them
    bet on the outcome of each upcoming shot. Before every shot, each
    player chose whether to bet high in which case he or she would win 5
    cents for a hit and lose 4 cents for a miss; or bet low, in which
    case he or she would win 2 cents for a hit and lose 1 cent for a
    miss. The players were advised to bet high when they felt confident
    in their shooting ability, and to bet low when they did not. We also
    obtained betting data fro another player who observed the shooter.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  data analysis was the same tests as NBA FG
\item
  reports prediction correlations with result, other predictions, and
  prev result, etc.

E. Conclusion
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

A. Introduction
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  discussion of previous research.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the 1985 Gilovich tests lacked statistical power
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  streakiness is the presence of nonstationarity or autocorrelation in a
  binary sequence:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    nonstationarity (nonconstant prob between trials)
  \item
    can be modeled with overdispersion model
  \item
    autocorrelation (sequential dependency)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
B. Simulating models and data
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Using ``nearly'' sufficient statistics to approximate posterior
  density of interest, condidional on the statistic falline in a small
  interval about the observed value.
\item
  simulate using regular gibbs algorithm
\end{enumerate}
C. Fitting overdispersion model (on data where one suspects
nonstationarity)
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Mike Schmidt batting data
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}

\item
  how do we measure streakiness/non-homogeneity?
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    sufficient stats included:
  \item
    T1 = difference between max and min moving average (10-game bins)
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{1}
  \item
    T2 = sum of the abs difference of moving avgs and season avg
  \item
    T3 = number of ``runs'' (consecutive 1s and 0s) in sequence
  \item
    T4 = length of the longest run in seq
  \item
    T5 = number of runs exceeding a specified length
  \item
    T6 = \(log[(n_{00}n_{11})/(n_{01}n_{10})]\) \(n_{ij}\) = ijth index
    of matrix classifying game i and j as hot or cold. (j=i+1)

    T6 \textgreater{} 0 if strong autocorrelation
  \item
    using logistic function where p = hit\% and xk = batting avg for
    last k games; logit(p) = B0 + B1*xk T7(k) = B1 \textgreater{} 0
  \item
    T8 = sd(p1, \ldots{}, pN) (given N bins of batting data)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Markov switching model
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    two hitting states \(p_{hot}\) and \(p_{cold}\)
  \item
    compared to ``coin toss'' model with constant prbability
  \item
    simulating results of games showed that there is not evidence for
    hot hand

\end{enumerate}
Koehler \& Conley (2003)

A. prior research

B. procedure
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  analyze NBA 3-pt contest footage (4 years, 23 shooters (some rpt
  contestants), 56 total rounds)
\item
  search for seq dependency within shooters across all shots, and per
  set of 25 shots
\end{enumerate}
C. results
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  no evidence of hotness or seq dependencies
\item
  runs analysis from each shooter
\item
  conditional probability analysis
\item
  analysis of how they shot when announcers said a player was getting
  hot
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the 3 before the announcer jinx were high but not the one
    immediately after.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
D. discussion
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  recent streaks of success are not predictive of future performance;
  use base rate
\item
  irrational hot hand belief may lead to exploiting market
  inefficiencies
\item
  future research might focus more on implications of the false belief
  in the hot hand rather than on pinpointing where hotness exists
\end{enumerate}
Bar-Eli, Avugos, \& Raab (2006)
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduction
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a review of 20 years of hot hand research.
\item
  in short: 11 support, 13 not support
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    but the supportive ones are typically weaker/have questionable data
    or unrealistic model
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  so far, the scientific support for the hot hand is controversial and
  fairly limited
\item
  but the belief in it is important.
\end{enumerate}
B. Preliminary Hot hand research
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  assumption that prob of success is affected by physical or
  psychological state.
\item
  the scientific norm of randomness may present it as a fallacy but it's
  useful because it affects real life decisions
\item
  after gilovich 1985 paper, more applications appeared
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    other sports: baseball, volleyball, golf, tennis, bowling, darts,
    horseshoes
  \item
    non sports: economics, cognitive science, law, religion
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
C. The Origin of the belief
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  memory bias: streaks are more memorable and thus wrongly regarded as
  nonrandom
\item
  general misconception: people often disregard sample size. people
  expect more alternations than what is normal.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    law of small numbers (fallicious belief that law of large numbers
    applies to small samples)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  gambler's fallacy (states that a streak of events is likely to end)
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    basically the opposite of the hot hand fallacy
  \item
    but both can be explained by ``representativeness'' and sequence
    recency.
  \item
    they're interpreted inversely because slot machines are seen as
    unintentional while shooting a basketball is seen as intentional.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
D. The validity of the Belief
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  studies that provide evidence against some investigate the link
  between belief and behavior instead of just a simple ``is it real?''
\item
  evidence for
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Larkey et al 1989:
  \item
    they used shorter chunks within a game (seq of 20 baskets) because
    extracting individual sequences from an actual game is too
    complicated
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    found out that Vinnie Johnson was indeed streaky
  \item
    but they only used 7 makes within a string of 20 in one game.
  \item
    and turns out that the stats were incorrectly recorded and the 7 in
    a row never even happened!
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Waldrop 1995
  \item
    interesting insight about the Simpson's paradox and how shooting
    better after a make may be seen in aggregated data but not
    individually.
  \item
    Gilden and Wilson (1995)
  \item
    asked random ppl to do darts and putts, but with little compensation
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    therefore streakiness could be lack of motivation
  \item
    also sample size was huge, which means lower p-vals in general
  \item
    Clark 2003
  \item
    PGA stuff. Any clustering of scores thought to be explained by
    hotness was actually explained by course difficulty
  \end{enumerate}

    Dorsey-Palmateer and Smith 2004
  \item

    next opponent was sitting and waiting)
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \setcounter{enumii}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    results of indiv rolls within games did not exhibit this.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
E. Hot Hand Test Statistics
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Gilovich 1985 (used simplification of binomial model; has questionable
  power.)
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    prob of hit conditioned on results of previous shot(s)
  \item
    first-order correlation coef
  \item
    Wald-Wolfowitz runs analysis test
  \item
    grouping blocks of 4 shots
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Wardrop (1999) simulated streaky data to see how binom tests detected
  it
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it wasn't good; they didn't detect unless the change was extreme,
    partially because of small sample sizes too
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Miyoshi (2000) suggested 4 variables that affected power of model:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    frequency of hot periods
  \item
    number of shots in all hot periods for a season
  \item
    number of shots in each hot period
  \item
    magnitude of probability increase during a hot period
  \item
    with these parameters set realistically, Gilovich's power would have
    only been 0.12
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  so no matter how you slice it, it's difficult to model basketball
  events
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the alternative hypothesis is not that streakines exists, but that
    it exists for everybody in the same way. this is unreasonable.
  \item
    an effective and powerful test for one person may not work for
    another
  \item
    1 person may exhibit non stationarity while another exhibits
    autocorrelation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
F. Implications of hot hand belief
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  sports gambling
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  this paper looked at studies that collected real data and simmed data
\item
  question remains unanswered
\item
  Gilovich somewhat strongly showed evidence against seq dep. but the
  nonstate test wasn't powerful enough according to simulation studies.
\item
  stepping further than the ``is there a hot hand?'' question
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    investigating the norms used by people to justify belief in it
  \item
    look at situational factors that enable us to judge the value of the
    belief (strategic advantage vs detrimental fallacy)
  \item
    investigate how important it is to real decisions (gambling,
    coaching, etc.)
  \item
    if hot hand doesn't exist, then training and preparation and sports
    psych methods should reflect this (but they don't, of course)

Inherent subtle but substantial selection bias when measuring conditional dependence of current outcomes on past outcomes in sequential data.
\end{verbatim}
\item
\begin{verbatim}
We prove that for any finite sequence of binary data, in which each outcome of "success" or "failure" is determined by an i.i.d. random variable, the proportion of 1s among the outcomes that immediately follow a streak of consecutive 1s is expected to be strictly less than the underlying (conditional) probability of success.

  \item
    each seq has an equal prob of happening, but in group a. you record

    individually weighted the least.

    equivalent sensitivity in shot prediction from shooters and
    observers suggests that shooters can't use internal cues to predict
    shot EVEN WHEN THE LIGHTS WERE OFF AFTER RELEASE!!!
  \item

    shooters when lights stayed on
  \item
    OFF 1st \textless{} OFF 2nd \textless{} OFF 3rd
  \item
    weak positive recency (streakiness, for makes or misses) WAS
    FOUND!!!! occurred mostly in OFF trial.
  \item
    optimism thing occurred mostly in the ON trial, even though it would
    have been more justified in the OFF trial. suggests that shooters'
    beliefs in hotness may depend on other factors such as bball lore
    rather than visual feedback.
  \item
    possible that the lore is a result of lack of awareness of
    statistical fluctuations within a game, players usually take a small
    number of shots, so it would take very large changes in hot hit prob
    to be measurable in-game. this controlled data does not suggest
    these large changes exist.

\chapter{Data}\label{data}

The data for this analysis is from SportVU, a player-tracking system
from STATS, LLC. that provides precise coordinates for all ten players
and the ball 25 times per second. The Duke University Men's Basketball
team permitted the use of their SportVU data from the \emph{blank} to
\emph{blank} basketball seasons. However, since the ability to record
this data depends on six specialized tracking cameras, Duke does not
have this data for every game they play---only home games, and a few
road games. Therefore, there is some missing data \emph{blank}.

Each game has the following associated files:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Box Score Optical:
\item
  Final Sequence Optical (one for each half and each overtime period):
\item
  Final Sequence Play-by-Play Optical:
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Procedure}\label{proc}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Using data that consists of a time-stamped sequence of shot attempts
  and outcomes, I will develop a novel analysis using dynamic models for
  binary time series that allow for time-varying shot attempt and
  success parameters over the game. These Bayesian models have core
  elements that are technically similar to widely used ``volatility''
  models, and have well-known attributes (Prado and West, 2010) (West
  and Harrison, 1997). This first project component will apply and tune
  such models to the player-specific data for a series of games or
  shooting drills. The models provide flexibility in adapting to changes
  of time intensity of shot attempts, and of changes in time in scoring
  probabilities conditional on a shot attempt. The use of a formal
  Bayesian analysis means that I will produce full quantified inferences
  on such patterns over time, with probabilistic summaries of the
  within-game outcomes. For each game, this will be a full statistical
  characterization and quantification of the player shooting
  outcomes---based on the limited data alone, of course---which across
  multiple games provides understanding of inherent variability (or
  ``randomness'') for the player, and formal assessments of differences
  in patterns game-to-game. I am also considering a two-state Hidden
  Markov Switching Model that parallels and extends these models; the
  two potential states for each shot attempt are a ``high'' probability
  or a ``low'' probability of making the next shot, given the features
  of the current and previous possessions.
\item
  If I am given data that adds on-court position for each shot attempt
  in a game, I will extend the above models to more explanatory, and
  potentially predictive, dynamic generalized linear models, or DGLMs
  (West, Migon, and Harrison, 1985) (West and Harrison, 1997), for
  binary time series. In these models the characterization of variation
  in shooting behaviour and outcomes will be then linked to time within
  the game coupled with the x-y location of the player on the shot
  attempt. For example, two coupled logistic regression DGLMs for binary
  outcomes will model (a) the probability of a shot attempt being made
  as a function of both time within the game and of the x-y position of
  the player, and (b) the probability of success on a shot attempt,
  conditional on that attempt being made at, as a function of both time
  and location. Important to the project is the evaluation of dynamic
  models that allow for and estimate any changes over time within the
  game in how strongly the x-y location might relate to the attempt and
  success probabilities. Developing full Bayesian statistical inferences
  on these patterns over time will be of central interest game-by-game,
  and this will then feed into cross-game comparisons.
