["index.html", "My Final College Paper Introduction", " My Final College Paper Nathaniel Brown May 20xx Introduction Welcome to the R Markdown thesis template. This template is based on (and in many places copied directly from) the Reed College LaTeX template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX or LaTeX before. Using R Markdown will also allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in R chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output included as well. The hope is this R Markdown template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road. Hopefully, you won’t have much of a learning period to go through and you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis. The use of LaTeX in combination with Markdown is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you’ve written before, taxing Word’s capabilities. After working with Markdown and R together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward. Why use it? R Markdown creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in R to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, R Markdown also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using R functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project. Further, it allows for R results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results. You’ll see more on this later. Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits! Who should use it? Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use R Markdown. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of Markdown and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.

Donald Knuth designed when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics. One nice feature of R Markdown is its ability to read LaTeX code directly. If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section. \\[\\sum_{j=1}^n (\\delta\\theta_j)^2 \\leq {{\\beta_i^2}\\over{\\delta_i^2 + \\rho_i^2}} \\left[ 2\\rho_i^2 + {\\delta_i^2\\beta_i^2\\over{\\delta_i^2 + \\rho_i^2}} \\right] \\equiv \\omega_i^2 \\] From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden): After n such encounters the posterior density for \\(\\theta\\) is \\[ \\pi(\\theta|X_1&lt; y_1,\\dots,X_n&lt;y_n) \\varpropto \\pi(\\theta) \\prod_{i=1}^n\\int_{-\\infty}^{y_i} \\exp\\left(-{(x-\\theta)^2\\over{2\\sigma^2}}\\right)\\ dx \\] Another equation: \\[\\det\\left|\\,\\begin{matrix}% c_0&amp;c_1\\hfill&amp;c_2\\hfill&amp;\\ldots&amp;c_n\\hfill\\cr c_1&amp;c_2\\hfill&amp;c_3\\hfill&amp;\\ldots&amp;c_{n+1}\\hfill\\cr c_2&amp;c_3\\hfill&amp;c_4\\hfill&amp;\\ldots&amp;c_{n+2}\\hfill\\cr \\,\\vdots\\hfill&amp;\\,\\vdots\\hfill&amp; \\,\\vdots\\hfill&amp;&amp;\\,\\vdots\\hfill\\cr c_n&amp;c_{n+1}\\hfill&amp;c_{n+2}\\hfill&amp;\\ldots&amp;c_{2n}\\hfill\\cr \\end{matrix}\\right|&gt;0\\] Lapidus and Pindar, Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations in Science and Engineering.

["3-ref-labels.html", "Chapter 3 Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels 3.1 Tables 3.2 Figures 3.3 Footnotes and Endnotes 3.4 Bibliographies 3.5 Anything else?", " Chapter 3 Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels 3.1 Tables In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in R that you saw in [R Markdown Basics] using the kable function, you can also create tables using pandoc. (More information is available at http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables.) This might be useful if you don’t have values specifically stored in R, but you’d like to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows and columns. Table 3.1: Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child Factors Correlation between Parents &amp; Child Inherited Education -0.49 Yes Socio-Economic Status 0.28 Slight Income 0.08 No Family Size 0.18 Slight Occupational Prestige 0.21 Slight We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table 3.1. If you go back to [Loading and exploring data] and look at the kable table, we can create a reference to this max delays table too: Table ??. The addition of the (\\#tab:inher) option to the end of the table caption allows us to then make a reference to Table \\@ref(tab:label). Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared. 3.2 Figures If your thesis has a lot of figures, R Markdown might behave better for you than that other word processor. One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter. You’ll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier. If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and R Markdown will automatically adjust the numbering for you. No need for you to remember! So that you don’t have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple R functions have been created for you to assist. You’ll see their use below. In the R chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as duke.png in our main directory. We then give it the caption of “Duke logo”, the label of “dukelogo”, and specify that this is a figure. Make note of the different R chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document). include_graphics(path = &quot;figure/duke.png&quot;) Figure 3.1: Duke logo Here is a reference to the Duke logo: Figure 3.1. Note the use of the fig: code here. By naming the R chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here. We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option fig.cap. Below we will investigate how to save the output of an R plot and label it in a way similar to that done above. Recall the flights dataset from Chapter ??. (Note that we’ve shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.) We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014. Note also the use of the scale parameter which is discussed on the next page. flights %&gt;% group_by(carrier) %&gt;% summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;identity&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 3.2: Mean Delays by Airline Here is a reference to this image: Figure 3.2. A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv. Next, we will explore the use of the out.extra chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying &quot;scale= &quot;. Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the “subdivision.pdf” file. Figure 3.3: Subdiv. graph Here is a reference to this image: Figure 3.3. Note that echo=FALSE is specified so that the R code is hidden in the document. More Figure Stuff Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the out.extra chunk option. (Currently this only works in the PDF version of the book.) Figure 3.4: A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down As another example, here is a reference: Figure 3.4. 3.3 Footnotes and Endnotes You might want to footnote something.1 The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way. 3.4 Bibliographies Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero. The Duke librarians have created Zotero documentation at https://library.duke.edu/research/zotero. In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/. R Markdown uses pandoc (http://pandoc.org/) to build its bibliographies. One nice caveat of this is that you won’t have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the “at” symbol. For example, here’s a reference to a book about worrying: (Molina &amp; Borkovec, 1994). This Molina1994 entry appears in a file called thesis.bib in the bib folder. This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX. You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the bib folder. For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see the following documentation from Reed College at (http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html)2. There are three pages on this topic: bibtex (which talks about using BibTeX, at http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html), bibtexstyles (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html) and bibman (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources. If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file. You can download a variety of different style files at https://www.zotero.org/styles. Make sure to download the file into the csl folder. Tips for Bibliographies Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination. The cite key (a citation’s label) needs to be unique from the other entries. When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author’s name by the word “and” e.g. Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},. Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary. To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces. 3.5 Anything else? If you’d like to see examples of other things in this template, please contact Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel (email mine@stat.duke.edu) with your suggestions. We love to see people using R Markdown for their theses, and are happy to help. footnote text↩ Reed College (2007)↩ "],
["4-organization.html", "Chapter 4 Organization", " Chapter 4 Organization Your paper should be an evolving report on the project in all aspects developed so far, in the form of a draft scientific paper. It must be written in RMarkdown or LaTeX with figures included. Make sure all figures have font sizes and line widths set so that the final pdf versions are properly legible. Presentation (including correctness of mathematical equations, graphics, tables, citations and bibligraphy, as well as prose) should be pristine. All details of developments of models, code and examples/analyses must be clearly described – sufficient to that a knowledgeable reader will be able to follow the logic and replicate the analysis. By the end of the first (Fall) semester, you need to develop a readable interim report. In the second (Spring) semester your task is to evolve this paper into a complete write-up of your work, as if intending to consider submitting to a scientific journal. However primitive the content may seem to be at the start, start writing. A fairly standard outline is as follows: Title Abstract Chapter 1. Introduction (setting, problem description, citations, etc.) Chapter 2. Literature review A Next Chapter: Some papers have one or two chapters, some papers have several. Keep chapters relatively short: Each section should have one focus. For example, Chapter 3. New Statistical Models (theory, ideas) Chapter 4. Some Computational Issues Chapter 5. Simulated Data (evaluation of models) Chapter 6. Application (real motivating problem and data) … Chapter X. Conclusion (what was done, what was learned, what was good/bad, where research might or could go next) Appendix (maybe some extra math, details of code) Bibliography (use bibtex, per the example bib files) "]
